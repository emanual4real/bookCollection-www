# bookCollection-www

## This is the frontend of my book collection webapp.

- Database - Mongo on a linux box with Docker
- [Backend](https://github.com/emanual4real/bookcollection-api) - Node with express (Dockerize it in the future)
- [Frontend](https://github.com/emanual4real/bookcollection-www) - Node and React (later Dockerize with NGINX)

_NOTE: Technically, I'm a professional programmer because I'm paid at work to write code but I'm still learning. I'll welcome any feedback/comments/questions_
